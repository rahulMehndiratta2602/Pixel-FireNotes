Problem Statement:
In modern household, due to hectic work schedules, it is quite difficult to remember as well as manage the availability of mandatory commodities in an urban home. Not only working professionals, homemakers, job-seekers, and others fail to keep track of their inventories or scheduled meetings which in turn either delay or terminate their regular duties. Sometimes, most of the people forget that they already have sufficient stock of certain item, and end up re-buying the same stuff again (toothpaste, soap, face wash, etc.) as a result lose money and time. The inability of efficiently managing the home inventories will not only impacts work schedules, but also causes stress, anger, and impatience. An automated application is proposed and intended to develop in order to keep track of the regular activities and aid people in managing the daily home inventories. 

We present Pixel FireNotes which is an answer for all above mentioned issues.
